basic projects to learn javascript and nodejs.

I started to learn javascript by making projects. To get an idea as to how to do one, I followed a follow along tutorial and did a easy rock paper scissor game. 

The next project is a slider ball into a moving basket game. This I did after planning a basic game layout to get a easy grip to code in js and using event listeners. 

The canon ball game shoots men as they fall from helicopter. This gave a good understanding in using vanilla js without any animation to move divs using arrow and space bar keys!
