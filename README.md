rock paper scissors
basic games to learn javascript.

I started to learn javascript by making projects. To get an idea as to how to do one, I followed a follow along tutorial and did a easy rock paper scissor game. [in branch rock-paper-scissors]

The next project is a slider ball into a moving basket game. This I did after planning a basic game layout to get a easy grip to code in js and using event listeners. [in branch game1]

The canon ball game shoots men as they fall from helicopter. This gave a good understanding in using vanilla js without any animation to move divs using arrow and space bar keys![in branch canon-game]
