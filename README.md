ball slider game
 a basic game that i coded on my for the very first time to implement basics of javascript. 
 a silder with a ball moves as the game starts and using space bar user has to throw ball into a moving basket. As the user goals the basket moves faster.

shooting game
 a upgrade to the complexity of the games. as men fall from helicopter, a canon which can move using arrow keys has to be used to shoot the men. have to shoot as many men as possible within 30 secs!
